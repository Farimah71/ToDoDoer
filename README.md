## Run
This project was bootstrapped with [create-vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

```diff
Compatibility Note: Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+, 16+.
However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
```
You can download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if you haven't installed it yet.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

You are using the default build output location(dist). This location can be changed using `build.outDir`, and you can extrapolate instructions from [these guides](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-outdir) in that case.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.
The vite `preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

For more configuration about the port of the server for `preview` command, visit [this page](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally).

## Project file structure
React doesn’t have opinions on how you put files into folders. There are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem:

- Grouping by features or routes
- Grouping by file type

In this project, the second approach(**grouping by file type**) is used.
