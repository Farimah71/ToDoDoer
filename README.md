## Demo

https://farimah71.github.io/ToDoDoer

## Run
This project was bootstrapped with [create-vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

```diff
Compatibility Note: Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+, 16+.
However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
```
You can download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if you haven't installed it yet.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

You are using the default build output location(dist). This location can be changed using `build.outDir`, and you can extrapolate instructions from [these guides](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-outdir) in that case.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.
The Vite `preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

For more configuration about the port of the server for `preview` command, visit [this page](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally).

## Project file structure
React doesn‚Äôt have opinions on how you put files into folders. There are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem:

- Grouping by features or routes
- Grouping by file type

In this project, the second approach(**grouping by file type**) is used.

## State management
**Redux Toolkit** is used for managing react state to provide a single source of truth for our data.


The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
